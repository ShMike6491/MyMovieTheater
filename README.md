Libraries Used
---------------------------

- **Foundation** - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for multidex and automated testing.
   - **AppCompat** - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
   - **Android KTX** - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
- **Architecture** - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data persistence.
